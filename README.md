# Welcome to my application!
**This project was created to learn NodeJS, Express and Mongoose.**<br/>
The project is available here: http://peaceful-mesa-99107.herokuapp.com/ . Note that you cannot upload any photos here due to heroku `free plan` limitations.<br/>
To run this project locally make sure you've created `keys.dev.js` in the `keys` directory that contains all the params from `keys.prod.js`.
